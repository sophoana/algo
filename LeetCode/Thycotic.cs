/*
 * You are tasked with writing an algorithm that determines the value of a used car, 
 * given several factors.
 * 
 *    AGE:    Given the number of months of how old the car is, reduce its value one-half 
 *            (0.5) percent.
 *            After 10 years, it's value cannot be reduced further by age. This is not 
 *            cumulative.
 *            
 *    MILES:    For every 1,000 miles on the car, reduce its value by one-fifth of a
 *              percent (0.2). Do not consider remaining miles. After 150,000 miles, it's 
 *              value cannot be reduced further by miles.
 *            
 *    PREVIOUS OWNER:    If the car has had more than 2 previous owners, reduce its value 
 *                       by twenty-five (25) percent. If the car has had no previous  
 *                       owners, add ten (10) percent of the FINAL car value at the end.
 *                    
 *    COLLISION:        For every reported collision the car has been in, remove two (2) 
 *                      percent of it's value up to five (5) collisions.
 *                    
 * 
 *    Each factor should be off of the result of the previous value in the order of
 *        1. AGE
 *        2. MILES
 *        3. PREVIOUS OWNER
 *        4. COLLISION
 *        
 *    E.g., Start with the current value of the car, then adjust for age, take that  
 *    result then adjust for miles, then collision, and finally previous owner. 
 *    Note that if previous owner, had a positive effect, then it should be applied 
 *    AFTER step 4. If a negative effect, then BEFORE step 4.
